# Lists of first (given) names in txt

These lists are compiled from three sources:

http://www.prenoms.ca/

http://www.vornamen.ch/

https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/liste-de-prenoms/

If by chance anybody is interested in R scripts which I used, just let me know.

All the names are in lowercase and without accents. I used them to estimate the gender structure
for a list of people, and typically, for a European company, they are helpful for something 
like 85% of people in the list.

But attention, the intersection is significant: to be precise, there are 964 names which are in both lists. 
They include not only "jean", which is both French male [ʒɑ̃]  and female [dʒiːn] of Scottish origin,
but also names like "andrea" which is male in Italy and "marie" which could be male in old French.
